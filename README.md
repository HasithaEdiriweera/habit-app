# USAGE

The application has a simple user interface for creating and managing habits. You can create a new habit by clicking the "Add Habit" button, and delete/edit a habit by clicking the "Delete" or "Edit" icon in React frontend.

Each 2 hours of time notification is sent to the Slack channel via webhook integration.

# Configuration

- Fixed token configured as an environment variable 'AUTHENTICATION_TOKEN'

- Slack webhook integration

- To configure Slack webhook integration, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Slack app and enable incoming webhooks.

2. Create a new webhook for the app and note down the webhook URL.

3. Set the webhook URL as an environment variable named SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL.

- To run the slack notifications : rake notifications:send_random_notification

# Rails configuration

The Rails server runs on port 3001 by default. To change the port, set the PORT environment variable.

The Rails application uses a PostgreSQL database by default. To use a different database, update the database.yml file.

# Testing

The backend is tested using Minitest. To run the tests, use the following command:

rake test
